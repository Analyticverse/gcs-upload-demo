    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide provides detailed instructions on how to upload EMR files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the gcloud CLI. This is the simplest method for uploading files to GCS buckets. However, you can also using REST APIs or Google’s client libraries in Python, C++, Java, Node.js, etcetera.\n\nNote: In order to access the GCS bucket by any of the methods listed above, you must have a Google Account associated with your institutional email address. Provide this email address to the Connect Coordinating Center who will provide you with write permissions for your site’s GCS bucket."

If you have multiple accounts and the desired account is not indicated by the asterisk, you can change the selected account with\ngcloud config set account &lt;YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS&gt;\n\n\nStep 2: Set the GCP Project.\nSet the Connect GCP Project IDs as environment variables.\nexport CONNECT_DEV=nih-nci-dceg-connect-dev\nexport CONNECT_STG=nih-nci-dceg-connect-prod-6d04\nexport CONNECT_PROD=nih-nci-dceg-connect-prod-5519\nVerify that they are set as expected.\necho $CONNECT_DEV\necho $CONNECT_STG\necho $CONNECT_PROD\nSet the project to using the appropriate environment, e.g., DEV.\ngcloud config set project $CONNECT_DEV\nVerify that your project is set.\ngcloud config get project\n\n\n\nStep 3: Upload file to GCS bucket\nFor convenience set your set your destination bucket and as an environment variable.\nexport CONNECT_GCS_BUCKET=gs://YOUR_SITES_BUCKET/\necho $CONNECT_GCS_BUCKET\nCopy the EMR file from your local filesystem to the GCS bucket.\ngcloud storage cp &lt;PATH/TO/YOUR_EMR_FILE.CSV&gt; $CONNECT_GCS_BUCKET\nEnsure that your file is uploaded to the bucket.\ngcloud storage ls ${CONNECT_GCS_BUCKET}/&lt;YOUR_EMR_FILE.CSV&gt;\nIf your file was successfully uploaded you should see the file listed as output in the terminal."
